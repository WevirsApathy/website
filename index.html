                        What makes Wevirs Apathy so special is the use of additional details of common elements, turning them into special elements. 
                        These reinterpretations make each piece even more unique, offering an alternative and fantastic view, which invites the viewer
                         to see things in a new way.
                        <br><br><br>
                        The project was conceived in 2022, but in May 2024, it was taken seriously thanks to the contribution of a second person who 
                        improved its aesthetics.

                        As we mentioned before, the collection has a unique style, characterized by details largely derived by creative and 
                        imaginative abilities, in fact, it is rare to find elements that coincide with something real and common, or, if they 
                        are present, they undergo significant modification to better adapt to the overall style.

                        The characters in the collection are robots called Wevirs with whom they show no interest in anything, 
                        coinciding with the character of apathy that marks one of the most important aspects of the collection.

                <p class="tempFont">
                    On the planet NHeras-27, there lived unique beings known as Wevirs, who inhabited vast mountain caves and thrived in harmony with their environment. 
                    They drew sustenance by absorbing energy from the minerals embedded in the rocks, transforming this energy into life force.  <br><br>
                    Over time, each Wevir developed a preference for a specific mineral, which gradually shaped their physical forms to resemble 
                    the minerals they relied on, making each one uniquely valuable and distinct. <br><br>
                    Their story is entwined with an ancient mystery: during an exploratory mission, humans accidentally left behind some robots on the planet.
                    Equipped with advanced AI, these abandoned robots eventually learned to replicate themselves, using the planet's resources to create new 
                    beings in their image.  <br><br>
                    However, these replicas, like their predecessors, were not programmed to feel emotions, leading to the emergence of a 
                    society defined by an overwhelming sense of apathy. <br><br>
                    Will they ever remember their abandonment?<br> And if not, might they one day discover it?
